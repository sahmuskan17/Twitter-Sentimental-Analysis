# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment from Twitter data. The primary goal is to derive insights from negative feedback, identify potential collaborators from consistently positive accounts, and strategically time product launches based on sentiment trends.

## Business Problem
- **Analyze negative feedback**: Gain insights into product weaknesses and drive improvements.
- **Identify positive accounts**: Collaborate with accounts showing consistent positive sentiment.
- **Timing product launches**: Schedule new product releases during periods of high positive sentiment.

## Project Structure
- **Import Libraries**: Necessary libraries for data processing and model training.
- **Load Dataset**: Load and preprocess the dataset.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Model Training**: Train a sentiment classification model using Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.
  
## Results
- The results section will include:

- Visualizations of sentiment distributions.
- Word clouds representing positive and negative sentiments.
- Model performance metrics and evaluation results.
